# AWS-CloudWatch-Automation

**Summary**
This project uses python to automate a notification system. The notification system uses CloudWatch to monitor traffic to an EC2 compute instance and invokes a Lambda function to notify an autoscaling group to add more compute resources. Notifications are then sent to a Slack Application.
